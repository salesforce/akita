### The Query

Avoid creating selectors in your components:

```ts title="nav.component.ts"
@Component({})
class NavComponent {
  isLoggedIn$ = this.authQuery.select(state => !!state.token);
  
  constructor(private authQuery: AuthQuery) {
  }
}
```

Instead, create them in the query:

```ts title="auth.query.ts"
export class AuthQuery extends Query<AuthState> {
  isLoggedIn$ = this.select(state => !!state.token);
  
  constructor(protected store: AuthStore) {
    super(store);
  }
}
```

This makes your components cleaner and the selectors reusable across the application.

### Data Storage Types
Store only plain objects in the store, avoid storing `Map` or `Set`. It's more efficient to perform immutable operations (which are required for updating the store) with plain objects rather than with complex ones such as `Map` or `Set`.
Moreover, it's harder to serialize this types of objects.

### UI State
Keep the UI data separated from the model data. Read more about this topic [here](ui).


### Keep It Simple
Avoid over-engineering. Don't create a separate store for any entity you may have. For example, you might have a list of articles where each article contains a list of comments:

```ts title="articles.store.ts"
interface Article {
  id: ID;
  comments: Comment[];
  title: string;
}

interface ArticlesState extends EntityState<Article> {
}

@StoreConfig({ name: 'articles' })
class ArticlesStore extends EntityStore<ArticlesState> {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}
```

In most cases, there is no need to create a separate entity store for the `comments`. Instead use Akita's [Array Utils](additional/array). This will keep your store easier to maintain and use. If you still require a separate store, check out this article for tips on how to combine their data:
